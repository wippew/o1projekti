    * view to an object that represents a particular domain; that object is the [[model]] of the view.
    * A `ViewFrame` displays the model as graphics within a GUI frame.
    *
    * This class is available under the alias `View` in the top-level package [[o1]], so students can
    * access it simply by importing `o1._`.
    *
    * The key method in the class is [[makePic]], which the view calls automatically and repeatedly to
    * determine which [[Pic]] to display in the frame at each moment in time. Concrete view objects must
    * add an implementation for this abstract method.
    *
    * A view listens to GUI events within the frame, but it doesn’t really do anything when notified
    * of an event; concrete instances of the class can override this behavior by overriding one of the
    * “on methods” (`onClick`, `onMouseMove`, etc.). The view also runs an internal clock and can react
    * to the passing of time (`onTick`).
    *
    * Just creating a view object is not enough to display it onscreen and start the clock; see the
    * [[start]] method.
    *
    * @param initialModel      the model to be displayed in the view (the only required parameter).
    *                          It usually makes sense to use a mutable object here and change its state

    *                          (optional; defaults to 24)
    * @param title             a string to be displayed in the frame’s title bar (optional)
    * @param initialDelay      an additional delay in milliseconds between calling [[start]] and the
    *                          clock starting (optional; defaults to 600)
    * @param terminateOnClose  whether the entire application should exit when the `ViewFrame` is closed
    *                          (optional; defaults to `true`)
    * @param closeWhenDone     whether the `ViewFrame` should be hidden and its clock stopped once the view
    *                          has reached a “done state” (as per [[isDone]]) (optional; defaults to `false`)

  /** This class provides a framework for building simple GUIs. Each instance of the class is a graphical
    * view to objects that represent the states of a domain model; those states can be (but are not required
    * to be) immutable objects. A `ViewFrame` displays the model as graphics within a GUI frame.

    * '''Note to students: this is not the view class that we commonly use in O1 but an alternative
    * implementation. For the usual `View`, see [[o1.gui.mutable.ViewFrame here]].'''
    *
    * The key method in the class is [[makePic]], which the view calls automatically and repeatedly to
    * determine which [[Pic]] to display in the frame at each moment in time. Concrete view objects must
    * add an implementation for this abstract method.
    *
    * A view listens to GUI events within the frame, but it doesn’t really do anything when notified
    * of an event; concrete instances of the class can override this behavior by overriding one of the
    * “on methods” (`onClick`, `onMouseMove`, etc.). The view also runs an internal clock and can react
    * to the passing of time (`onTick`).
    *
    * Just creating a view object is not enough to display it onscreen and start the clock; see the
